A structured decision journal template system designed for Notion, Markdown, and plain text workflows. Document your decisions before outcomes are known, then review them later to improve your decision-making process over time. This approach separates decision quality from outcome quality, helping you learn from every choice you make.

## Why Keep a Decision Journal?

The human brain is remarkably good at rewriting history. After we know an outcome, we unconsciously adjust our memory of what we believed and why we made certain choices. This hindsight bias prevents us from learning from our decisions because we cannot accurately recall our original reasoning.

A decision journal solves this by creating an honest record of your thinking at the time of the decision. By writing down your reasoning, expected outcomes, confidence levels, and emotional state before results are known, you create an invaluable feedback loop for improving your judgment.

Daniel Kahneman, Annie Duke, and Ray Dalio all advocate for systematic decision documentation. Warren Buffett famously writes down his investment thesis before buying, and reviews it later to identify where his thinking went right or wrong.

## Templates Included

### 1. Quick Decision Log (`templates/quick-decision.md`)
A lightweight template for everyday decisions. Takes 2-3 minutes to complete. Perfect for decisions like choosing between job offers, making purchases, or selecting strategies.

### 2. Deep Decision Analysis (`templates/deep-analysis.md`)
A comprehensive template for high-stakes decisions. Includes pre-mortem analysis, alternative evaluation, and stakeholder impact assessment. Use this for career moves, large investments, or strategic pivots.

### 3. Investment Decision Record (`templates/investment-decision.md`)
Specifically designed for investment and financial decisions. Tracks your thesis, valuation reasoning, risk factors, and exit criteria.

### 4. Team Decision Document (`templates/team-decision.md`)
For group decisions that need consensus tracking, dissenting opinions, and clear accountability assignments.

### 5. Monthly Decision Review (`templates/monthly-review.md`)
A retrospective template for reviewing past decisions. Compare your predictions against actual outcomes and calculate your calibration score.

## How to Use

### Markdown Workflow

1. Copy the template you need from the `templates/` directory
2. Fill it out at the time of decision (before knowing the outcome)
3. Store it in your personal notes system
4. Set a calendar reminder to review it after the outcome is known
5. Complete the review section and note your learnings

### Notion Integration

Import the templates directly into Notion:
1. Copy the template content
2. Paste into a new Notion page
3. Convert to a Notion template for reuse
4. Create a Decision Journal database with each entry as a page

## Template Structure

Every template follows this core structure:

| Section | Purpose | When to Fill |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Context | What decision are you facing? | At decision time |
| Options | What alternatives did you consider? | At decision time |
| Reasoning | Why did you choose this option? | At decision time |
| Confidence | How confident are you (0-100%)? | At decision time |
| Expected Outcome | What do you expect to happen? | At decision time |
| Emotional State | How are you feeling about this? | At decision time |
| Review | What actually happened? | After outcome known |
| Lessons | What did you learn? | After outcome known |

## Best Practices

- Write your journal entry **before** the outcome is known
- Be specific about your reasoning and confidence levels
- Include what would change your mind (kill criteria)
- Review decisions at least 30 days after making them
- Look for patterns in your decision-making over time
- Do not judge decisions solely by outcomes
